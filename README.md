# RGB_Image_Modeing_SummerResearch2018

This is one of the main project I did over the summer of 2018 at Villanova University under the guidance of Dr. David Chuss, a physicw professor at Villanova University. In this project, I modeled the RGB image of Orion nebula. Orion nebula is one of the most studied nebula in Astronomy and physics. If you want to learn more about the nebula, follow the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula. 

I used Python's package such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and APLpy to model the image and plotted magnetic field vectors over the map to show the direction of magnetic field in the region.
